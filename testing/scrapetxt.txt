              — Legendary MotorsportIt's a common story in Los Santos. The Obey 8F Drafter was your first car. The 9F was your first DUI. You finally got to third base in the back of the 9F Cabrio. Then the 10F came along, and you fell in love. This, at long last, was the real thing. Perfection. Then Benny came along and said "Perfection is just the beginning". And you know what? He's right... Eligible for customization at Benny's Original Motor Works.
